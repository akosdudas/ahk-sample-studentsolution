> The content of this file will be used to populate the description of the `pull request` the student will open. It serves as a reminder of what to do.

#### Reminder of how to use the pull request

- Once the pull request is opened, an automated evaluation will be executed. You will see its result in a comment. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can add further commits.
- You are limited to having **5 automated executions**. If you do not want the evaluation to run, close the pull request, then open a new one later, when you are ready.
- **Assign the pull request** to the instructor only **when you are finished**; this is the final submission.
- Do **not merge** the pull request.
